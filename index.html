    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Swapnil Kumar, a passionate web developer with a love for creating beautiful and functional websites. With a background in AI/ML student , I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks to bring ideas to life.</p>
    
    <p>My journey in web development began when I enrolled in Udemy and learned from youtube. Since then, I've worked on numerous projects, ranging from personal blogs to complex web applications.</p>
    
    <p>I believe that a great website is not just about aesthetics but also about user experience. I strive to create intuitive and engaging interfaces that meet the needs of users while also achieving the goals of the client.</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming and in working on "Try Hack Me". I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I'm excited to see where my passion for web development will take me next!</p>
    
    <p>If you'd like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out through the contact page!</p>
